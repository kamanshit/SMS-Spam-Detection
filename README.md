# 🚀 SMS Spam Detection

This project is a Machine Learning application that classifies SMS messages as 📩 Spam or ✅ Ham (Not Spam).
Built with Python, CountVectorizer, and Multinomial Naive Bayes, it achieves ⚡ 98% accuracy on the test data.

🛠 How It Works

🧹 Data Cleaning – Removes extra spaces, punctuation, and converts text to lowercase.

🔠 Feature Extraction – Transforms text into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer.

🤖 Model Prediction – Uses Multinomial Naive Bayes to classify each message.

📊 Output – Displays prediction as Spam or Ham.
